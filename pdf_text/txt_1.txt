Propulsion Module:

The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration
until a 100 km lunar orbit. It is a box-like structure with one large
solar panel mounted on one side and a large cylinder on top (the
Intermodular Adapter Cone) that acts as a mounting structure for
the lander.

Lander:

The lander is responsible for the soft landing on the Moon. It is also
box-shaped, with four landing legs and four landing thrusters of 800
newtons each. It will carry the rover and various scientific
instruments to perform on-site analysis.

The lander for Chandrayaan-3 will have only four throttle-able
engines, unlike Vikram on Chandrayaan-2 which had five 800
Newtons engines with a fifth one being centrally mounted with a
fixed thrust. Additionally, the Chandrayaan-3 lander will be
equipped with a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV). The impact legs
are stronger compared to Chandrayaan-2 and have increased
instrumentation redundancy. ISRO is working on improving the
structural rigidity and adding multiple contingency systems.
