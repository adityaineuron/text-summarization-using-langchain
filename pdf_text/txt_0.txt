Chandrayaan-3

Chandrayaan-3 is the third and most recent lunar Indian Space
Research exploration mission under the Chandrayaan program. It
consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan,
similar to Chandrayaan-2, but does not have an orbiter. Its
propulsion module behaves like a communication relay satellite.
The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration
until the spacecraft is in a 100 km lunar orbit.

Following Chandrayaan-2, where a last-minute glitch in the landing
guidance software led to the lander crashing after entering lunar
orbit, another lunar mission was proposed.

The launch of Chandrayaan-3 took place on July 14, 2023, at 2:35
pm IST, and lunar injection of a 100 km circular polar orbit was
completed successfully as part of phase one. The lander and rover
are expected to land near the lunar south pole region on August 23,
2023. The Chandrayaan-3 mission is a stepping stone towards
ISRO’s future interplanetary missions.

Objective
ISRO has set three main objectives for the Chandrayaan-3 mission,
which include:

1. Getting a lander to land safely and softly on the surface of the
moon

2. Observing and demonstrating the rover’s loitering capabilities
on the moon,

3. on-site observation and conducting experiments on the
materials available on the lunar surface to better understand
the composition of the moon.

Design
Chandrayaan-3 comprises three main components:
